# RFEst Data

This repo stored some example data used in RFESt example notbooks.

- `stnmf.zip` included a subset (1 cell) of Salamander RGCs spike train data stimulated by checkerboard white noise (Liu, et al., 2017). Full dataset can be download from [https://gin.g-node.org/gollischlab/Liu_etal_2017_RGC_spiketrains_for_STNMF](https://gin.g-node.org/gollischlab/Liu_etal_2017_RGC_spiketrains_for_STNMF)
- `Liu_et_al_2017.zip` included the complete dataset of (Liu, et al., 2017), without the stimulus, which is too big to upload to Github. Please reconstruct it yourself with the script above.
- `rgc_new.pickle` included 2-photon calcium imaging recorded for Figure 5D of RFEst.
- `rgc_dendrites.pickle` included additional data of intracellular recording and 2-photon calcium imaging from (Ran, et al., 2020).
